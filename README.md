## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

To get CareerCompass up and running, ensure you have the following installed:

* **PHP 8.2 or higher**
* **Composer** (for PHP dependency management)
* **Node.js and NPM** (for frontend asset compilation)
* **Database:** Either **SQLite** (default and recommended for easy local setup) or **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (if you prefer a dedicated database server).

---

### Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up CareerCompass locally:

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Bender-0/career-compass.git](https://github.com/Bender-0/career-compass.git)
    cd career-compass
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies and initialize the application:**
    This single command will handle several crucial steps for you:
    * Creates your `.env` file from `.env.example`.
    * Generates your application key.
    * Creates the storage symbolic link.
    * **Automatically sets up the SQLite database** with all necessary tables and sample data.
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
    * **Note on MySQL / PostgreSQL:** If you prefer to use MySQL or PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, you will need to:
        1.  Manually create your database (e.g., `career_compass` in MySQL).
        2.  After `composer install` has run, open the newly created `.env` file.
        3.  Fill in your database credentials:
            ```
            DB_CONNECTION=mysql # Or pgsql for PostgreSQL
            DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
            DB_PORT=3306 # Or 5432 for PostgreSQL
            DB_DATABASE=career_compass
            DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
            DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
            ```
        4.  Then, run the migrations and seeders manually to populate your chosen database:
            ```bash
            php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
            ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start Development Server:**
    You have a couple of options to run the development server:

    * **Option 1: Using Composer's `dev` script (recommended for simplicity):**
        This command will simultaneously start the Laravel development server, queue listener, logs, and Vite for asset compilation.
        ```bash
        composer run dev
        ```
    * **Option 2: Manual Startup (if you prefer separate processes):**
        First, compile the frontend assets:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        Then, start the Laravel development server:
        ```bash
        php artisan serve
        ```

5.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the development server is running, open your web browser and visit:
    `http://localhost:8000`

    You can log in with the default sample user:
    * **Username:** `user@example.com`
    * **Password:** `password`

---

## Sample Data

The application comes with sample data to help you get started. After running the migrations with the `--seed` flag, you'll have:

* 1 sample user (`user@example.com` / `password`)
* 18 sample job applications
* Associated contacts, notes, and tasks

To reset and reseed the database at any time, run:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
